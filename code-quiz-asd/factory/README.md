### Factory

Your job here is to create a factory function that has five parameters.

Name: `factory` (it must be called this)
Parameters: `id`, `x`, `y`, `speedX`, `speedY`
Returns: an object with properties called `id`, `x`, `y`, `speedX`, and `speedY`
Description: create an object that uses the input parameters to assign corresponding values to the created object


**NOTE:** You do not need to call the function after creating it.

**Example:**
```javascript
  let result = factory("myId", 17, 23, 99, -5);
  /*
    result would be
    {
        id: "myId",
        x: 17,
        y: 23,
        speedX: 99,
        speedY: -5
    }
  */
```
